# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**blobert** is a Godot 4+ game project. The primary scripting language is GDScript.

## Reference projects (`reference_projects/`)

Third-party and demo Godot projects live under `reference_projects/`. Subdirectories may be used for implementation reference (patterns, APIs, scene structure, `project.godot` examples) **except** under Godot’s official demo repo: **ignore `reference_projects/godot-demo-projects/2d/`** — those are pure 2D demos and do not match blobert’s 3D scene target; prefer `3d/`, `xr/`, `viewport/`, and other non-`2d/` trees inside `godot-demo-projects/` when relevant. Treat the tree as read-only upstream material: do not add blobert game code or assets under `reference_projects/`, and do not point blobert’s `project.godot` at resources inside it. Examples include `reference_projects/3D-Platformer-Kit/` and `reference_projects/godot-demo-projects/` (excluding `2d/` as above).

## Development target: 3D scenes

Development is for **3D scenes**: 2.5D with one 3D world and 2D-like gameplay.

- **Main scene:** `res://scenes/levels/sandbox/test_movement_3d.tscn` (set in `project.godot` as `run/main_scene`).
- **Player:** `PlayerController3D` in `scripts/player/player_controller_3d.gd`; scene `scenes/player/player_3d.tscn`. Use **CharacterBody3D**, **Camera3D**, **Area3D**, **Node3D**, etc. for new gameplay and levels.
- **Movement logic:** Shared pure simulation in `scripts/movement/movement_simulation.gd` (no Node/Input); the 3D controller maps Vector2 → Vector3 and drives physics.
- **New tests** should use the 3D scene (see `tests/scenes/levels/test_3d_scene.gd`).

## Agent checkpoints (autopilot / autonomous agents)

- **Full checkpoint text** (`Would have asked` / `Assumption made` / `Confidence`) belongs only in scoped files: `project_board/checkpoints/<ticket-id>/<run-id>.md`.
- **`project_board/CHECKPOINTS.md` is index-only:** run headers, resume pointers, one-line outcomes, and `Log:` paths. Do **not** append full checkpoint bodies or `**Would have asked:**` blocks there.

## Common Commands

`direnv` puts `bin/godot` (headless wrapper) and `ci/scripts/` on PATH automatically.

```bash
# Canonical full suite: Godot (bounded fail-fast import + tests) then asset_generation/python pytest
timeout 300 ci/scripts/run_tests.sh

# Godot-only (same 300s test timeout; import is not bundled here)
timeout 300 godot -s tests/run_tests.gd

# Force reimport (rebuilds class cache — run if tests fail to load scripts). Prefer bounded import via run_tests.sh in CI.
timeout 120 godot --headless --import
```

## ⏱ Always Use Timeout

When invoking Godot outside of `ci/scripts/run_tests.sh`, use a timeout to prevent hanging:
- `timeout 300 godot -s tests/run_tests.gd` — Godot suite only
- `timeout 120 godot --headless --import` — import/reimport only (fail-fast; stderr not discarded)

## ⚠️ Do Not Use `--check-only`

`godot --check-only` hangs indefinitely in this project. In Godot 4.6.1 headless mode it initializes the main scene, which runs physics scripts without collision resolution — the enemy falls forever and the process never exits. The test runner catches parse errors directly (script load fails with an explicit error), so `--check-only` provides no additional safety.

## File Editing & Moves

Prefer `git mv` for renames/moves so history is preserved.
